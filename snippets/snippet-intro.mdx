One of the core principles of software development is DRY (Don't Repeat
Yourself). This is a principle that apply to documentation as
well. If you find yourself repeating the same content in multiple places, you
should consider creating a custom snippet to keep your content in sync.
JACoB works via a custom GitHub app and a Figma Plugin, along with a command-line tool to set up the configuation options. Here's how to set up JACoB in just a few quick steps.
