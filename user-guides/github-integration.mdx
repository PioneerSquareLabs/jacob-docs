JACoB is designed to interact with you and your team using GitHub issues and pull requests. JACoB will respond to a variety of commands in the body or comments of GitHub issues and pull requests. Each command begins with `@jacob-ai-bot` and will trigger a corresponding task.

### @jacob-ai-bot

- If this appears in the body of a new issue, JACoB will evalute the issue body and, if possible, commit code in a new pull request.
  - If the issue includes `=> filename.extension` in the title, JACoB will start by creating a new file with that filename in the pull request.
- If this appears in the body of a pull request review, JACoB will attempt to address the review comments and commit code to the pull request branch.
- Currently, this is only supported for JavaScript or TypeScript projects.

### @jacob-ai-bot build

- Can appear in an issue or pull request comment (not in the body).
- Triggers a build to ensure that JACoB can build the repo.
- Currently, this is only supported for JavaScript or TypeScript projects. This command can be useful when verifying changes to the `jacob.json` settings file in your repo.

### @jacob-ai-bot fix error

- Can appear in a pull request body or comment (not in an issue body or comment).
- JACoB will look in the same body or comment for a blockquote below the heading `## Error Message` to understand what errors need to be fixed.
- JACoB will commit code in the pull request branch in an attempt to fix the error.
- If the updated code fails to build or (optionally) pass its tests, it will comment on the pull request with another `@jacob-ai-bot fix error` command.
- Currently, this is only supported for JavaScript or TypeScript projects.
