JACoB is designed to interact with you and your team using GitHub issues and pull requests. JACoB will respond to a variety of commands in the body or comments of GitHub issues and pull requests. Each command begins with `@jacob-ai-bot` and will trigger a corresponding task.

### @jacob-ai-bot

- If this appears in the body of a new issue, JACoB will evalute the issue body and, if possible, commit code in a new pull request.
  - If the issue title includes `=> filename.extension`, JACoB will start by creating a new file with that filename in the pull request.
- If this appears in the body of a pull request review, JACoB will attempt to address the review comments and commit code to the pull request branch.
- Currently, this is only supported for JavaScript or TypeScript projects.

### @jacob-ai-bot build

- Can appear in an issue or pull request comment (not in the body).
- Triggers a build to ensure that JACoB can build the repo.
- This command can be useful when verifying changes to the `jacob.json` settings file in your repo.
- Currently, this is only supported for JavaScript or TypeScript projects.

### @jacob-ai-bot code review

- Can appear in a pull request body or comment (not in an issue body or comment).
- JACoB will perform a code review on the changes in the pull request branch.
- If JACoB generates pull request comments, the review will be marked as "Request Changes".
  - Feel free to dismiss the review after making changes, or request another review by adding the same command in a new comment on the PR.
- If JACoB does not have any comments or suggestions, the review will be marked "Approved".
- This command can be used to ask JACoB to review pull requests generated by JACoB. In this case, the reviews will always be marked as "Comment".
- This IS NOT limited to JavaScript or TypeScript projects. It has limited testing on other types of projects and we welcome feedback on the results.

### @jacob-ai-bot fix error

- Can appear in a pull request body or comment (not in an issue body or comment).
- JACoB will look in the same body or comment for a blockquote below the heading `## Error Message` to understand what errors need to be fixed.
- JACoB will commit code in the pull request branch in an attempt to fix the error.
- If the updated code fails to build or (optionally) pass its tests, it will comment on the pull request with another `@jacob-ai-bot fix error` command.
- Currently, this is only supported for JavaScript or TypeScript projects.

### @jacob-ai-bot create story

- Can appear in a pull request body or comment (not in an issue body or comment).
- Currently, this command can only be used in a very specific scenario. JACoB adds this command on its own pull requests after creating a new component in a project that has a `.storybook` directory in the root.
- JACoB will create a storybook story in a new file to aid in previewing a testing the new component.
- Currently, this is only supported for JavaScript or TypeScript projects.

### Pull Request Reviews

- JACoB will respond to pull request reviews that it authored. No `@jacob-ai-bot` is needed to trigger this task.
- Limitation: JACoB will only respond to the primary body comment of the pull request review and will ignore comments on specific line numbers. This will improved in the future.
- Currently, this is only supported for JavaScript or TypeScript projects.
