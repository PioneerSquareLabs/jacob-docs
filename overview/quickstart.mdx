Embark on your JACoB journey with this Quickstart guide, designed to help you set up and start using JACoB with minimal setup. We provide you with a sample GitHub repository and a Figma tutorial file to illustrate JACoB's capabilities.

## Setting up Your Repository

Start by setting up your project using our GitHub template, which is pre-configured for JACoB integration. This template is a NextJS project with Tailwind CSS and JACoB pre-configured.

<Tip title="Creating a Repository from a Template">
  If you're not familiar with creating a new repository from a template, follow
  GitHub's guide which provides step-by-step instructions. [GitHub's guide on
  creating a repository from a
  template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
</Tip>

## Installing the JACoB AI Bot

Next, you need to install the JACoB AI Bot on your GitHub account. This bot will work with your repository to automate coding tasks, review code, and manage pull requests.

1. Go to [JACoB AI Bot GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/jacob-ai-bot).
2. Install the application and grant it permission to access the new template repository you just created. Feel free to add it to other repositories as well.

## Exploring the Figma File

Finally, open the Figma template to see examples of components that JACoB can generate for you. The Figma template includes four components, starting with a simple example and progressing to more to complex dynamic components. This tutorial will take about 15-30 minutes to complete.

By following this Quickstart guide, you'll quickly learn how JACoB can automate your coding tasks, from generating code from Figma designs to creating pull requests for review.

## Next Steps

Once you've tried JACoB with the sample Figma file, you can start using JACoB with your own designs and projects. For more information on how to set up JACoB on your existing project, check out the [Installation Guide](/installation/guide).
