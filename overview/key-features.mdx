## Explore JACoB's Features

JACoB is an open-source tool built to assist developers with end-to-end tasks. It's designed to work like a junior developer, helping you transition from designs to production-level front-end components efficiently.

JACoB integrates with Figma for front-end development and automates GitHub tasks for backend processes. It maintains all state within GitHub issues, comments, and PRs, creating issues via a simple Figma plugin.

The system follows a configurable set of steps, including build, test, plan, and code, until your code builds and the commit is ready. It also includes a command-line config that gathers more information about your personal coding style, tailoring the output to your preferred tools and patterns.

Currently, JACoB primarily supports React components and works best with NextJS and Tailwind, although other Node-based setups are easy to configure. Check out this [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfRUaehTcEM) for more information.
