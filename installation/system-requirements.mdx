## System Prerequisites

Before diving into the installation of JACoB, it is essential to ensure that your system meets the following requirements. These prerequisites are necessary to make the most out of JACoB's capabilities and ensure a smooth integration with your development process.

### Core Requirements

- **NodeJS Environment**: JACoB is designed to operate within a NodeJS-based environment. Ensure that you have NodeJS installed on your system. This will allow JACoB to interface with your codebase and execute necessary scripts.
- **GitHub Repository**: Your project should be hosted on a GitHub repository. JACoB utilizes GitHub APIs for various automation tasks, which requires access to your repository's code.
- **Figma Document**: An editable Figma design document is required for JACoB to translate your designs into code. Make sure you have access to the Figma document you wish to work with.

### Recommended Stack

- **NextJS**: While JACoB supports various frameworks, it works best with NextJS. This framework provides an optimal balance of performance, scalability, and developer experience that complements JACoB's features.
- **TypeScript**: To leverage JACoB's full potential, we recommend using TypeScript in your project. TypeScript provides strong typing and compile-time error checking, which enhances JACoB's ability to generate accurate and reliable code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling, Tailwind CSS is the recommended choice. Its utility-first approach is well-suited for the dynamic and componentized code that JACoB produces.

### Upcoming Support

We are continually working to expand JACoB's capabilities. Support for additional platforms and frameworks is on the horizon, so stay tuned for updates.

Once you've confirmed that your system meets these requirements, you're ready to proceed with the installation of JACoB. Follow the installation guide to get started and join the future of AI-powered coding.
