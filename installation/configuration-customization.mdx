## Configuration Settings

Setting up JACoB to align with your project's conventions is crucial for maximizing efficiency and ensuring the code generated by JACoB meets your standards. JACoB's configuration tool allows you to customize how the bot writes code, selects languages, frameworks, and more, so it feels like an extension of your team. Whether it's adapting to your code patterns or following your directory structure, JACoB is designed to fit seamlessly into your workflow.

To begin customizing JACoB for your project, run the setup command in your project directory. This interactive tool will guide you through a series of questions to tailor JACoB's behavior to your unique coding style:

```bash
npx jacob-setup create
```

This command will launch a wizard that asks you about your project's specifics, such as coding language, styling methods, and preferred libraries. The goal is to have JACoB generate code that is not only functional but also indistinguishable from what you and your team would write by hand.

Once you have run this command and answered the questions, JACoB will create a `jacob.config` file in your repo's root directory. This file acts as JACoB's guide when generating code and can be edited at any time as your project evolves.

Here are the current configuration options (more are coming soon!):
